# API

There are two ways of interacting with DocSpring. You can use the graphical environment of our dashboard, which we recommend for beginners as it is easy, and quick to get started there. Both PDF and HTML templates are supported in the dashboard, and you can even generate forms automatically based on your template's schema.

Then, for more advanced users, we have a series of API endpoints which enable you to create, modify, and generate PDFs. We already support many languages, and we have a JavaScript library, but any programming environment capable of making API requests will work well.

In this section of the documentation you can learn about the API and what functions we support.

Our API is also published as a Postman collection available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15111350/TzCHBVaY#cd722171-120f-4d21-bfe2-d6096688eb19).
