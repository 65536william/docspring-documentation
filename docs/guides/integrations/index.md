# Integrations

We have AWS S3 integration, so you can upload PDFs to your own S3 bucket. This integration applies to all templates, submissions, and combined submissions in your account.

We also have a [plugin on Bubble](https://bubble.io/plugin/docspring---fill-and-generate-pdfs-1573478783306x235198545630593020), so even if hard coding isn't your thing, you can still build an interface for your DocSpring templates.

We will be adding more integrations in the future. We are also working on a redesign and improved UI, so you will have more fine-grained control over your integrations.
