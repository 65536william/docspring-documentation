# Welcome to Docspring Documentation

DocSpring makes it easy to fill out and generate PDFs. Automagically.

1. Create a template.
Upload existing PDFs in the editor. Or design a new HTML page with dynamic fields directly in the code.

2. Build a form.
Design a form to match your UI, or create an easy web form. You can embed our web forms too.

3. Submit the data.
Your user fills in the form, and then you send the data as a JSON object to our API. Web forms do this by default.

4. Your PDF is generated.
Our API returns a download link to the filled-in PDF, almost immediately. Welcome to a speedy workflow.
