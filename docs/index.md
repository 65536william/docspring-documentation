# What is DocSpring?

DocSpring is a **speedy cloud service** which enables you to **generate PDFs dynamically**. Our API inserts data (usually from a form) into your template and provides the completed PDF within seconds.

## Get started

1. In our dashboard, upload or create the document that you want to be filled out. Empty documents are called *templates*, and we support two different types:
    - You can easily make a [PDF template](/guides/template-editor) from an existing file. Simply upload a `.pdf`, and drag and drop fields onto the page. If your file already has fillable fields, the editor will automatically import them.
    - Alternatively, build a dynamic [HTML template](/guides/html-css-templates) and style it with CSS. Since these templates rebuild on each API request, they are very customisable and flexible.

Then connect our API and the template ID to your form – websites, apps, and CRMs all integrate well. Alternatively, you can use our free form builder, and we'll host.

Now your user simply fills in the form and clicks 'submit'. Your form should send the data to our API as a JSON object.

Boom! Our servers automatically fill out your template with the data, and then our API returns a link to download the PDF. DocSpring is very fast.

## Who uses DocSpring?

Most of our users take advantage of the API to automate their workflows and to make filling out documents less dull for their customers.

Imagine trying to get car insurance fifty years ago. An agent would need to handwrite your details onto a piece of paper, slowly going through each line. It's a waste of time all round, it's prone to errors, and the document only lives in some remote filing cabinet.

DocSpring revolutionises this bureaucratic process. Our users build elegant, easy forms for their customers. The PDFs are generated within seconds and are available worldwide in the cloud. Everything is automatic: no need for an agent any more.
